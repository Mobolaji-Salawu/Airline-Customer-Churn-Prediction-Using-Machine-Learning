# Airline-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
## 📌 Overview
In today’s highly competitive business environment, **customer retention has become a top priority for organizations across all sectors** — and the airline industry is no exception. Retaining existing customers is not only more cost-effective than acquiring new ones but also critical for sustaining long-term profitability and growth.

**Customer churn**, which refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company or switch to a competitor, poses a significant threat to both **revenue and market share**. High churn rates can erode customer bases, inflate acquisition costs, and diminish brand loyalty, ultimately weakening an organization’s competitive positioning in the market.

Research consistently shows that **acquiring a new customer can cost 5 to 7 times more than retaining an existing one**. This makes it imperative for businesses, including those in aviation, to proactively identify at-risk customers and implement strategies aimed at improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a **supervised machine learning classification model** capable of predicting whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical customer data. This project aims to:
* **Forecast potential customer churn**
* **Uncover key factors driving churn**
* **Support targeted retention strategies**
These insights can help airlines forecast potential customer exits and take proactive measures such as offering incentives, improving service quality, or launching targeted marketing campaigns to retain valuable customers.

## 📊 Why Machine Learning for Churn Prediction?
**Supervised machine learning techniques, particularly classification analysis**, are well-suited for churn prediction because they can learn from labeled historical data to distinguish between customers who have churned and those who have not. This allows businesses to classify current customers based on their likelihood of leaving.

Beyond just predicting churn, **machine learning models can also identify the key drivers behind customer attrition**. By analyzing feature importance and examining customer attributes such as satisfaction scores, loyalty program membership, travel frequency, and service experience, businesses gain actionable insights into the factors most influencing churn. This information is invaluable for guiding marketing strategies, service improvements, and customer engagement initiatives.

## 📊 Project Workflow
* **Data Import & Cleaning:**
Merged two datasets — one containing customer loyalty history and the other tracking flight activity. Handled missing values and derived new features like total flights, points earned, and active status in 2018.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explored trends and patterns in customer activity, loyalty engagement, and other variables that might influence churn.

Feature Engineering:
Created relevant features such as total flight counts, total points earned, 2018 activity status, and churn labels.

Model Building & Evaluation:
Applied supervised classification algorithms to predict churn risk and evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics.

Insights Extraction:
Identified key factors contributing to customer attrition, offering valuable guidance for targeted marketing and operational improvements.

## 📈 Key Benefits
* **📌 Forecast customer churn risk** to enable timely, targeted retention strategies

* **📌 Identify top factors contributing to churn**, providing data-driven insights for operational and marketing improvements

* **📌 Optimize marketing spend and customer relationship management** by focusing efforts on high-risk customers

* **📌 Enhance customer experience and loyalty programs** based on predictive insights
