# Airline Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning
## ðŸ“Œ Overview
In todayâ€™s highly competitive business environment, **customer retention has become a top priority for organizations across all sectors** â€” and the airline industry is no exception. Retaining existing customers is not only more cost-effective than acquiring new ones but also critical for sustaining long-term profitability and growth.

**Customer churn**, which refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company or switch to a competitor, poses a significant threat to both **revenue and market share**. High churn rates can erode customer bases, inflate acquisition costs, and diminish brand loyalty, ultimately weakening an organizationâ€™s competitive positioning in the market.

Research consistently shows that **acquiring a new customer can cost 5 to 7 times more than retaining an existing one**. This makes it imperative for businesses, including those in aviation, to proactively identify at-risk customers and implement strategies aimed at improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a **supervised machine learning classification model** capable of predicting whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical customer data. The project aims to:
* **Forecast potential customer churn**
* **Uncover key factors driving churn**
* **Support targeted retention strategies**

These insights can help airlines not only forecast potential customer exits but also take proactive measures such as offering incentives, improving service quality, or launching targeted marketing campaigns to retain valuable customers.

## ðŸ“Š Why Machine Learning for Churn Prediction?
**Supervised machine learning techniques, particularly classification analysis**, are well-suited for churn prediction because they can learn from labeled historical data to distinguish between customers who have churned and those who have not. This allows businesses to classify current customers based on their likelihood of leaving.

Beyond just predicting churn, **machine learning models can also identify the key drivers behind customer attrition**. By analyzing feature importance and examining customer attributes such as satisfaction scores, loyalty program membership, travel frequency, and service experience, businesses gain actionable insights into the factors most influencing churn. This information is invaluable for guiding marketing strategies, service improvements, and customer engagement initiatives.

## ðŸ“Š Project Workflow
* **Data Import & Cleaning:**
Merged and cleaned two customer datasets â€” one detailing loyalty program histories and the other tracking flight activity.

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Uncovered trends and patterns in customer behavior, demography, flight activity, and loyalty program engagement.

* **Feature Engineering:**
Created meaningful features such as tenure, total flights, points earned, and activity status to better capture customer behavior. Also transformed categorical features into a numerical representation, scaled numerical variables to have a similar scale, and addressed class imbalance in the target variable.

* **Model Building & Evaluation:**
Implemented supervised machine learning classification models to predict churn, evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics, and selected the most suitable models in the ensemble model for deployment.

* **Insights Extraction:**
Identified top factors contributing to customer churn, providing valuable business insights for targeted retention campaigns, service enhancements, and customer loyalty initiatives.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters
* **Customer retention is critical** to long-term business success, especially in industries like aviation with potential for high customer lifetime value.

* **Acquiring new customers costs significantly more** than retaining existing ones.

* **Predictive models help businesses forecast churn** and take proactive, data-driven actions.

* **Machine learning can reveal the most important factors influencing churn,** empowering airlines to fine-tune their loyalty programs, service quality, and marketing efforts.

## ðŸš€ Conclusion
This project showcases how blending business understanding with machine learning can lead to smarter decision-making, solve practical problems, reduce customer attrition, and improve profitability in the airline industry.

Machine learning offers a powerful, data-driven approach for predicting customer churn and uncovering the reasons behind customer attrition. By integrating predictive analytics into customer relationship management processes, airlines can not only reduce churn but also foster long-term customer loyalty, improve profitability, and maintain a strong competitive edge.
